Dependency Injection in Spring MVC
----------------------------------
Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern that is commonly used in software development to manage the
dependencies between different components or objects in an application. In the context of Spring MVC, which
is a web framework based on the Spring framework for building Java web applications, Dependency Injection (DI)
refers to the process of injecting (or providing) the dependencies required by a particular object or component,
rather than that object or component creating or managing its own dependencies.

In other words, instead of a component or object creating its dependencies directly or managing their lifecycle, the
dependencies are "injected" or provided to the component or object from an external source, usually by a framework
or container. This allows for loose coupling between components, as components do not need to be aware of how their
dependencies are created or managed, and allows for easier testing, re-usability, and maintainability of components.

Spring MVC provides built-in support for dependency injection through its IoC (Inversion of Control) container,
which is a core feature of the Spring framework. The IoC container is responsible for creating and managing objects
(beans) in a Spring application, and it can inject dependencies into beans based on their configuration, either
through XML configuration files, Java annotations, or Java code.

By using dependency injection in Spring MVC, you can easily manage and inject dependencies into your controllers,
services, data access objects (DAOs), and other components, making it a key feature for building scalable and
maintainable web applications.

Loosely Coupled Architecture
----------------------------
Loosely coupled architecture is a design principle in software development where components or modules of a system
are designed to have minimal dependencies on each other. In a loosely coupled architecture, components or modules
are designed to be independent and can be modified or replaced without affecting the entire system. This promotes
flexibility, reusability, and maintainability of the software system.

In a loosely coupled architecture, components or modules communicate with each other through well-defined
interfaces, typically using abstract contracts or APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). This allows components
or modules to be developed, tested, and deployed independently, without tightly coupling them to specific
implementations or dependencies.

Benefits of loosely coupled architecture include:

1. Flexibility: Components or modules can be easily modified, replaced, or extended without impacting the entire
system, making it easier to adapt to changing requirements or business needs.

2. Reusability: Loosely coupled components or modules can be reused in different contexts or systems, reducing
duplication of code and promoting code sharing.

3. Maintainability: Changes or updates to a specific component or module do not require extensive modifications to
other parts of the system, making it easier to maintain and troubleshoot.

4. Testability: Loosely coupled components or modules can be tested independently, making it easier to isolate and
fix issues.

5. Scalability: Loosely coupled architecture allows for the system to be scaled horizontally or vertically by adding
or modifying components or modules without tightly coupling them to the existing system.

Overall, a loosely coupled architecture promotes flexibility, reusability, maintainability, and testability of
software systems, making it a desirable design principle in software development.
